A simple IMDb/Netflix stylized app for JavaScript and API demonstration purposes for the "Code With Me" Meetup group.

Of note: This relies on an API Key from the http://www.omdbapi.com/ movie database. You can instantly and easily apply for your own API Key on the Open Movie Database site.

Once you have your API key, please add the file "key.js" to the JS folder of this project with the following code in it:

const APIKEY = '{{Your API KEY HERE, Between the curly braces, with the curly braces removed. KEEP the single quotes!}}';
